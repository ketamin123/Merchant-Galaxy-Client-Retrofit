<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
This is the Merchant Galaxy Trading Guide client done with Retrofit. Client only.
Note that validation is also done on both Front-end and Back-end. So, even if you somehow bypass the Front-end validation, Back-end will still reject the request.
To change API's url, go to com.prospace.merchant.client.Application on the baseUrl variable.	
<br>Back-end:
<br><a href="https://github.com/ketamin123/Merchant-Galaxy-Currency-Converter">Merchant Galaxy in Spring</a>

<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
To run the app, import project to your IDE, run Application.java or compile to .jar and run `java -jar file.jar`.
