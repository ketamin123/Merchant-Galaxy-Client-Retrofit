<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
This is the Merchant Galaxy Trading Guide Command Line Interface Client done with Retrofit. Client only.
<br>Note that validation is also done on both Front-end and Back-end. So, even if you somehow bypass the Front-end validation, Back-end will still reject the request.
<br>To change API's url, go to com.prospace.merchant.client.Application on the baseUrl variable.	
<br>Back-end:
<br><a href="https://github.com/ketamin123/Merchant-Galaxy-Currency-Converter">Merchant Galaxy in Spring</a>

<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
